        <h1>LilGuy</h1>
            <p>LilGuy is a little program that runs Lua scripts and communicates with a SQLLite database. With custom Lua scripts, LilGuy can perform simple tasks such as monitor a network connection, communicate with a smart device, or host a private web page for a home media server or web portal.</p>

            <p>People used to need a powerful computer and knowledge of networking technologies to make their own server, but with LilGuy you can set up a server without having to know everything.</p>

            <p>LilGuy installs and sets up all the pieces someone would need to get started working on a project right away.</p>

        <h2>About</h2>
        <h3>What IS LilGuy?</h3>
            <p>LilGuy was originally imagined as a way to communicate between two WiFI devices on a home network so that when one of the access points experienced a problem it would send a signal to automatically restart the router without anyone needing to intervene. As Dylan worked on this project, he realized that with a few more features it could become useful for all kinds of home projects.</p>
            <p>LilGuy is an easy way to set up a database server connected to a network to do useful things on a computer, RaspberryPI device, or even a  phone.</p>
